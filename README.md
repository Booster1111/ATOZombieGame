# ATOZombieGame

Ah, zombies. Cannot kill what’s already dead, right? But you sure can outsmart them by using your trader’s wits and crafting expertise.
Zombie apocalypse or not, humans love shopping, and they’ll always need a shop to come in for stuff. Natural exchange is all good, but we’ve been building an exchange system based on commodities and money for a few thousand years now, and surely for a reason! So, just because some undead creatures are persistently trying to savor the flavor of your brains, threatening your survival in these dark new circumstances, you shouldn’t give up shopkeeping progress, oh no!

Join this adventure to hone your survival, trading and production skills!
— Become a shopkeeper running the only decent outlet in town seeking to thrive amidst the zombie apocalypse
— Learn the secrets of post-apocalyptic trade to expand and customize your shop
— Make friends with Artisans, Scientists, and other town residents to design and produce weapons, armor, and many other useful items from any bits and bobs you can lay your hands on, really
— Source valuable resources such as Metal, Plastic or Chemicals from different town locations and use them to produce goods
— Sell items to customers: they need all these Baseball Bats, Flashlights and Cleavers to fend off zombies that are rather annoying in their persistence to eat all the brains
